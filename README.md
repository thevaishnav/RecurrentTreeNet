# RecurrentTreeNet
High-Level Module to write extremely powerful Artificial Neural Networks.
Features:
  Able to create Feed Forward as well as Recurrent Neural Networks 
  One Layer can take input from multiple layers 
  Any layer can be connected to any other layer in the network using the Edge class
  Every Edge class instance can have a different Activation Function
  Every Layer and/or Edge can have different Optimizer
