# RecurrentTreeNet
High-Level Module to write extremely powerful Artificial Neural Networks.
Features:
  1) Able to create Feed Forward as well as Recurrent Neural Networks 
  2) One Layer can take input from multiple layers 
  3) Any layer can be connected to any other layer in the network using the Edge class
  4) Every Edge class instance can have a different Activation Function
  5) Every Layer and/or Edge can have different Optimizer
